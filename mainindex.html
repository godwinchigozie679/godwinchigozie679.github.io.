        <h3>Here's a time line of Bishop David Oyedepo's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In <b>1954</b> - Bishop David Oyedepo was born to a muslim family in Osogbo, Nigeria, but is a native of
                Omu-Aran, Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara State. His fathers name is Ibrahim, who is a healer.
            </li>

            <li>In May <strong>1981</strong> Bishop David Oyedepo gave his life to Jesus Christ.</li>

            <li>Bishop David Oyedepo studied architecture at the Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin and worked briefly with
                the Federal Ministry of Housing in Ilorin before resigning to concentrate on missionary work. Oyedepo
                received a PhD in Human Development from Honolulu University, Hawaii, US.</li>

            <li>He had an 18 hours vision in May <strong>1981</strong>, to liberate the world from all oppression of the
                devil through the preaching of the word of faith.</li>

            <li>This vision led to the founding of the <strong title="Living Faith Church World Wide">LFCWW</strong>
                first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981.</li>

            <li>Two years later, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian
                Church of God, ordained David and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (known as Faith Abiola Oyedepo) to
                become pastors and officially commissioned the new church. Five years later, Oyedepo was ordained as
                Bishop.</li>

            <li>In <strong>1998</strong>, he was instructed by God to build a new base for the Commission to accommodate
                the increasing number of worshippers, which led to the building of 50,000-seat capacity auditorium, the
                'Faith Tabernacle'</li>
